# Okta-Scripts

Collection of Scripts that leverage the okta powershell module

You'll need to install and configure the [Okta-PSModule](https://github.com/mbegan/Okta-PSModule) before you can run these scripts.

I've included some basic notes within the scripts themselves, if you have questions ask here or within the [Okta Community](https://support.okta.com/help/community).

## Script specific How-To's

- [saveEventLogs](https://github.com/mbegan/Okta-Scripts/blob/master/saveEventLogs.md) (Note that the Okta events API has been [superceded by](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/events-api-migration/) the System Log API.  Thus, you should use the V2 script.
